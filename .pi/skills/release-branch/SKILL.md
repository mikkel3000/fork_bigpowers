# Release Branch

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT merge or release if tests fail or if coverage gates are not met. If the branch is red, return to `develop-tdd` to fix regressions or add missing tests before proceeding.

Finalize a completed feature branch: verify coverage gates, integrate onto `main`, and clean up the worktree.

## Additional modes
- `--hotfix`: Cherry-pick to main + tag. Skip PR in solo.
- `--squash-state`: Squash `chore(state):` commits before merge.

## Integrate mode

Read `specs/state.yaml` key `workflow_mode` (`team-pr` | `solo-git`). Fall back to `profiles/solo-git.md`.

| Mode | When | Ship path |
|------|------|-----------|
| **solo-local** | `workflow_mode: solo-git` | Auto: `scripts/land-branch.sh` if present, else fallback (Step 5) |
| **team-pr** | `workflow_mode: team-pr` (default) | `gh pr create` → `gh pr merge --squash` |

If unsure, prefer **solo-local**. Also read `state.yaml` `vcs.kind`: Git follows the procedures below; Jujutsu uses workspaces/bookmarks and must not call Git-only landing scripts.

## Process

> **Timing:** `bash scripts/bp-timing.sh start release-branch` at invocation; `bash scripts/bp-timing.sh end release-branch` before handoff.

### 1. Final verification

```bash
<full test command> && <typecheck command> && <lint command>
git log main..HEAD --format=%B  # Review full messages and release hints
# Block AI agent attribution (P1)
git log main...HEAD --format="%B" | grep -qiE 'co[- ]authored[- ]by' && echo "❌ Co-authored-by footer found — blocked" || echo "✅ No AI attribution"
```

- [ ] All tests pass, no type errors, no lint violations, all commits follow versionedcommits
- [ ] **NO `Co-authored-by` or `Co-Authored-By`** in any commit body — P1 rule (CONVENTIONS.md § Git Attribution). `land-branch.sh` blocks the merge if found.

### 2. Coverage check

- [ ] Overall coverage ≥ 80%; business logic coverage ≥ 95%

### 2a. Security gate

- [ ] `specs/security/REVIEW.md` exists and is fresh (matches current branch diff)
- [ ] No unresolved HIGH findings with confidence ≥ 8 (or all documented in `specs/security/EXCEPTIONS.md` with sign-off rationale)

If REVIEW.md is missing or stale → run `security-review` inline. Findings block the merge unless documented in EXCEPTIONS.md.

### 2b. Traceability gate

Run `gate-trace` before merge. FAIL blocks merge; CONCERNS requires explicit override in `specs/state.yaml` (`traceability_override: CONCERNS accepted, reason: <explanation>`). WAIVED if no matrix available.

> **Adversarial refute framing (e45s32):** The final pre-merge check is **refute, not rubber-stamp**. Before declaring ready, actively try to disprove traceability completeness — missing story tags, absent verify evidence, stale security review. Only proceed when refutation fails.

### 3. Diff review

- [ ] All commits intentional, no secrets, CONVENTIONS.md compliance

### 4. Decision

Options: **Release (solo-local)** / **Open PR** / **Keep branch** / **Discard**

### 5. Integrate

Run `commit-message` first. Git solo-local uses `land-branch.sh`. Jujutsu team mode explicitly advances and pushes a bookmark; `-m` is mandatory for commit/describe operations:

```bash
# Git solo-local
bash scripts/land-branch.sh <task-slug> $'Describe the change\n\n@minor Added the capability'
# Jujutsu team PR
jj describe -m $'Describe the change\n\n@minor Added the capability'
jj bookmark set <task-slug> -r @
jj git push -b <task-slug>
```

Jujutsu solo-local landing is unsupported: run `bp_require_vcs_operation "$PWD" land-branch` and stop with its remediation instead of invoking the Git backend.

### 6. Create PR (team-pr only)

Create the pull request with a **literal provenance marker** in the body so agent-generated PRs are identifiable and do not rot silently:

```markdown
<!-- bigpowers-provenance: agent-generated -->
```

Place the marker on its own line immediately after the `## Summary` heading. Then merge via `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<!-- bigpowers-provenance: agent-generated -->

- ...

## Test plan
- [ ] ...

EOF
)"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

Preserve the release metadata explicitly in the final squash body using `gh pr merge --squash --subject "..." --body-file <release-message-file>`. The versionedcommits action reads those hints, prepares a release PR, and tags its merge after checks pass (see `docs/RELEASE.md`).

### 7a. Archive completed epic capsule

> **HARD GATE** — When all epic stories are done (all `done` in `execution-status.yaml`), archive the capsule:

```bash
mv specs/epics/eNN-slug specs/epics/archive/
```

### 7b. CI verification & agent lock release (e39s02)

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT declare success until CI completes. **Three-independent-facts** (e45s15): commit landed, workflow green, registry visible — see [REFERENCE.md](../../../skills/release-branch/REFERENCE.md#three-independent-facts-release).

```bash
bash scripts/wait-for-ci.sh --timeout 600 --interval 30
```

- [ ] CI passes; `release.ci_verified: true` in state.yaml
- On failure: `handoff.next_skill = fix-bug`

### 8. Clean up & return

Git: prune worktree, delete branch, return to main. Jujutsu: `jj workspace forget <workspace>` only after integration; do not delete its bookmark implicitly. Cycle-time: see [REFERENCE.md](../../../skills/release-branch/REFERENCE.md#cycle-time).

Report: "Branch released."

```

## Worktree cleanup details

```bash
# From the main repo root
git worktree prune
git worktree remove ../<branch-name> 2>/dev/null || true
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

If `git worktree remove` fails due to uncommitted changes, ask: "There are uncommitted changes in the worktree. Force remove? (y/n)". If yes: `git worktree remove -f ../<branch-name>`.

## Cycle-time recording

After landing the branch, record delivery metrics using the git-derived,
additive script (replaces hand-arithmetic):

```bash
bash scripts/record-cycle-time.sh append \
  --story <story_id> --bcps <bcps> \
  --range "$(git merge-base main HEAD)..HEAD" \
  --file specs/metrics/cycle-times.yaml
```

This appends a row to the cycle-times ledger with two separated metrics:

- **effort_hours** — ADDITIVE. Idle-stripped estimated effort from git commit
  history (git-hours model: 120-min session threshold, 120-min first-commit pad).
  Sums exactly to whole-repo effort. NO hand-arithmetic, NO wall-clock includes.
- **lead_time_minutes** — calendar latency from first commit to merge.
  Median-aggregated across stories; NEVER summed.

The script also runs an additivity self-check: Σ(story effort) == whole-repo effort
within rounding tolerance.

### Why not story_start minus story_end?

The previous hand-arithmetic approach (survey-context writes `story_start`,
release-branch writes `story_end`, agent hand-computes `cycle_minutes`) was
retired because:

1. It was **agent-self-reported** — trivially fabricated or mis-subtracted.
2. Wall-clock included **overnight/weekend/UAT gaps** — calendar latency,
   not coding effort.
3. The `bcp_per_hour` metric was **computationally meaningless** (velocity
   derived from a latency measurement).

The new approach derives effort from commit history (objective, reproducible)
and lead time from first commit → merge (honest calendar latency). See
`docs/references/bcp.md` for BCP sizing context and
`scripts/record-cycle-time.sh` for the full algorithm.

## CI verification

The CI polling logic has been extracted to `scripts/wait-for-ci.sh`.
See the script's `--help` for usage. Step 7b of the main SKILL.md invokes it directly:

```bash
bash scripts/wait-for-ci.sh --timeout 600 --interval 30
```

**Exit codes:**
- **0** — all workflows green. Set `release.ci_verified: true` in state.yaml.
- **1** — at least one workflow failed. Prints failure URLs. Set `handoff.next_skill = fix-bug`.
- **2** — timeout. CI did not complete. Retry or investigate.
- **0 with warning** — `gh` CLI not available, git-only fallback confirmed push landed but CI status unverified.

The script handles: auto-discovery of all workflows for the current
branch/commit, polling until completion, success/failure/timeout exit codes,
and git-only fallback when `gh` CLI is unavailable.

---

## Solo-local fallback detail

The fallback sequence (Path B above) handles the "remote has moved" case with `git pull --rebase`. Use when `scripts/land-branch.sh` is absent.

**Acceptance:** When fallback runs, main is updated, feature branch is deleted locally, and output states `"used fallback merge (land-branch.sh not found)"`.

## Handoff

Gate: READY -> next: survey-context
Writes: state.yaml handoff.next_skill = survey-context

## Reference block 1

```bash
# Fallback: manual squash-merge when land-branch.sh is absent
FEATURE_BRANCH=<task-slug>
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo main)

# Ensure we're on the feature branch
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" != "$FEATURE_BRANCH" ]; then
  git checkout "$FEATURE_BRANCH"
fi

# Checkout default branch and update
git checkout "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
git pull --rebase origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git pull origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"

# Squash-merge the feature branch
git merge --no-ff "$FEATURE_BRANCH" -m "<versionedcommits-message>"

# Push
git push origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"

# Clean up local feature branch
