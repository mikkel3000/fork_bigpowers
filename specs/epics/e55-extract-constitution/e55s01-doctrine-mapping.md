# Doctrine Mapping — e55s01

<!-- story: e55s01 -->

Maps every rule stated in bigpowers' current doctrine sources to exactly one of
bigspec's 11 constitution blocks (B0–B10) or Capstone. Block **definitions** are
taken from `specs/reborn-constitution.md` Part I as a **structural taxonomy
reference only** — this document maps what bigpowers' doctrine *actually says
today*; it does not adopt any of that draft's content-level claims (which target a
hypothetical future rewrite, not this repo).

## Manifest — 49 source files audited

  Responsibilities table — each fact owned by exactly one file), Generated
  artifact targets (`.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.pi/`, `website/` never
  hand-edited — edit `SKILL.md` sources), docs/references SSOT Sync (distilled
  from CLAUDE.md/PRINCIPLES.md/SKILL.md, never hand-edited ad hoc), Legacy

- Coverage-matrix artifact set, documentation structural-validity checks —
  source: `traceability-gate.md`, `verification-patterns-extended.md`

## B9 · Effort Accounting (BCP)

- Full BCP accounting mandate (sizing via `bcp.md`'s 6-step method,
  `plan-work` writes `epic_cycle.story_bcps`, `release-branch` computes
  BCP/hour), Timestamp mandate (`story_start`/`story_end`), BCP is
  story-level only (no per-task `[BCP N]`) — source: `CONVENTIONS.md` §BCP
  accounting mandate, §Timestamp mandate
- `effort:` frontmatter (light/standard/heavy) for skill selection, token-budget
  escalation thresholds — source: `context-engineering.md`, `model-profiles.md`
- BCP measures functional complexity not time; classify functional vs
  non-functional; decompose into Business Rules/Interface Elements/
  Boundaries; Fibonacci element scoring; size bands (small/medium/large/
  must-split ≥30); baseline in release-plan.yaml; velocity tracking in
  cycle-times.yaml — source: `bcp.md`
- BCP-Plus 13-dimension framework, Element Router/Sizer separation for lower
  variance — source: `bcp-plus.md`
- Release-plan BCP baseline + WSJF ordering, BCP/hour ≥2.0 target, per-task
  `[BCP N]` tags in older workflow docs (superseded by story-level-only rule
  above — a duplication/drift example), state-tracking of `story_bcps` and
  `current_step` — source: `workflow-artifacts.md`, `orchestration.md`,
  `orchestration-state.md`, `workflow-steps.md`

## B10 · The Synthesis

- 6-Phase Lifecycle (Discover→Elaborate→Plan→Build→Verify→Release; *Sustain*
  is a session-flow state, not a lifecycle phase), Hard Gates, Session
  Governance, 94% quality threshold — source: `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §6
- 6-phase core loop identically stated, `orchestrate-project` phase
  sequencing, semantic-release version progression from `0.0.0-β` — source:
  `orchestration.md`, `workflow-steps.md`, `git-integration.md`,
  `workflow-artifacts.md`
- BMAD's Discover→Elaborate→Plan→Build→Sustain arc, TEA's 9 workflows, SDD
  lifecycle integration across CLAUDE.md/elaborate-spec/plan-work/verify-work,
  DDD Strategic Design triage (Core/Supporting/Generic domain) — source:
  `bmad.md`, `tea.md`, `wasowski.md`, `ddd.md`

## ★ Capstone · Outcome Evals

**Tension flagged, not resolved here:** bigpowers' *current* proof mechanism is
a Gherkin-based self-compliance suite (`npm run compliance`, 94% threshold) —
source: `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §6/§7, `CLAUDE.md` §Commands, `code-review.md`,
`gates.md`. `reborn-constitution.md`'s Capstone definition explicitly states
this target block "replaces the legacy 94% Gherkin self-compliance gate" with
outcome evals (with-skill vs without-skill delta). That replacement is **e58's
job (evals-over-compliance), not yet built** — today's 94% gate is what
actually exists and is what e55s02 must describe accurately under whichever
block it lands in, without presenting Capstone's target-state eval mechanism as
already true.
- Request-review checklist / quality-score gate as today's closest analog —
  source: `code-review.md`
- Human-in-the-loop UAT mandate after every story (not automated code
  generation) — source: `spec-kit.md`
- `run-evals` + regression UAT phase, `specs/EVALS-<feature>.md` results —
  source: `workflow-steps.md`, `workflow-artifacts.md`

---

## Duplication findings (rule restated across ≥2 files — the drift problem e55 exists to fix)

- **6-phase lifecycle**: stated near-identically in `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §6,
  `orchestration.md`, and `workflow-steps.md`.
- **F.I.R.S.T testing**: stated in `CONVENTIONS.md` §Tests, `docs/PRINCIPLES.md`
  §1, `kent-beck.md`, `uncle-bob.md`, `tdd.md`, and `wasowski.md` — six sources
  for one rule.
- **P0–P3 risk-based verification depth**: stated in full in both `bmad.md` and
  `tea.md` with near-identical tier tables, and again (operationally) in
  `CONVENTIONS.md` §Risk Tiers.
- **BCP is story-level, not per-task**: `CONVENTIONS.md` states this as current
  policy; `workflow-artifacts.md`/`orchestration.md` still reference an older
  `[BCP N]` per-task tag convention — a live drift example, not just a stylistic
  duplication.
- **94%/quality-gate threshold**: stated in `docs/PRINCIPLES.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`
  (indirectly via Preflight), `gates.md`, and `code-review.md`.
- **Zoom-out before editing**: `pocock.md`, `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §3, and
  `orchestration.md`/`workflow-steps.md` (as a named HARD GATE) all state this.
- **Boy Scout Rule**: `CONVENTIONS.md`, `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` §1,
  `pragmatic-programmer.md`, `ousterhout.md`, and `workflow-steps.md`.

## No constitution-level content (reference/routing data, not stated rules)

- `accelerate.md` — DORA metrics mapped against existing skills; a capability
  audit, not a new rule.
- `bigpowers-mcp.md` — MCP server architecture/implementation detail.
- `model-profiles.md` — skill→model routing lookup table (operational
  reference; its token-budget escalation rule is the one piece counted under B9
  above).
- `e33-abandoned.md`, `e36-abandoned.md` — explicitly closed/abandoned epics
  (docs website, doc dedup); story-comment references only, no live rules.

## Unclear — needs a decision

- The `--fast` flag / BCP<3 zoom-out-skip optimization (`bcp.md`) sits between
  B9 (effort/sizing) and B10 (planning tempo) — doesn't cleanly fit either.
- **Catalog Freeze section** (`CONVENTIONS.md` §Catalog Freeze, e54-e59) is a
  migration-scoped, time-bound policy (expires when e56 merges) rather than a
  permanent doctrine rule — flagged for e55s02 to decide whether it belongs in
  `constitution.md` at all, or should stay only in `CONVENTIONS.md` as
  transitional process state.
